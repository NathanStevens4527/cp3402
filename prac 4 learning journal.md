##Content insights:
Up to this point I had primarily been working on my websites through one click install CMS systems
and had not tried to setup a local host development system. While I did encounter some challenges
with installation and setup I was able to get a local host up and running to develop a website in.
To meet the requirements of a dynamic website I decided to make a page that lists the range of
services my start up offers that is able to automatically expand when I add more services.

##Employability insights:

It is good to have experience working in various web development environments as it will allow me
to meet different requirements an employer may have or potentially different work environments they
may offer. Such experience also allows me to make informed decisions on what kinds of software and
hosting environments to use in any given situation or for what ever requirements a client may have
for their website or business needs.
