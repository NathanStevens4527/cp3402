#Nathan Stevens Week 6 learning journal

##Learning activities:

watched lecture video

##estimated hours: 3

##Content insights: 

The lecture video laid many of the requirements and expectations of the group project especially in relation to group conduct and the hands off approach in letting us run our teams independently. The purpose of this is to allow us to develop team work and leadership skills in our groups through out the project without relying on an external party to moderate any issues we may encounter. The lecture video also outlined the most important questions or issues our team will need to address first. These are fundamental team values such as what result we are all aiming for which will dictate how we plan to operate as a team through this assessment.

##Employability insights:

The experience gained from this project will be valuable in an industry environment as most employers will assign work to teams rather than individuals. For this reason it will be important to have skills in both leadership and working as part of a team or under leadership. This is also why it is important for my team to establish core agreements and values and to plan for how to deal with unreliable or non participating team members as these are issues we may encounter in a professional environment.
