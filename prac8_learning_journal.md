##Learning experiment

In keeping with the scientific method I approached my learning experiment in phases the first of which is question,
The question or aim for this learning experiment is how can I improve my learning method. 

The next phase is research so I briefly looked at different kinds of learning styles such as visual learning for 
example which was a concept I already had some knowledge on. I then thought back to how I normally consume and put
into practice learning material from this subject and others and concluded that I generally watch all lecture videos
consecutively and then work through practical or assignment work. Normally as I work these tasks I end up needing to
review lecture materials or look for help from other sources as I often fail to remember all details from the lecture 
videos. I concluded that this is likely a result of consuming them all in a very quick manner and that perhaps I should
change my learning style to be more conducive to absorbing the information in the videos. 

My hypothesis is that consuming the videos at a slower pace while taking notes or trying to practice the skills that are
being demonstrated in the will make me more likely to remember the lecture material when applying the information from 
them in the future. 

For the testing phase I put into practice the learning style changes outlined above. While watching the lecture videos I
paused numerous times to take notes and a handful of times I rewatched segments that I either didn’t fully understand on
first viewing or that seemed more information heavy. I also took a short break between both lecture videos to give my self
time to process the information. While something of this nature can’t be measured empirically I do feel that I got a stronger
grasp of the information in this weeks lectures regarding custom themes and will be able to apply this knowledge in the assignment.


##Content insights:

The lecture video laid many of the requirements and expectations of the group project especially in relation to group conduct and the hands off approach in letting us run our teams independently. The purpose of this is to allow us to develop team work and leadership skills in our groups through out the project without relying on an external party to moderate any issues we may encounter. The lecture video also outlined the most important questions or issues our team will need to address first. These are fundamental team values such as what result we are all aiming for which will dictate how we plan to operate as a team through this assessment.

##Employability insights:

The experience gained from this project will be valuable in an industry environment as most employers will assign work to teams rather than individuals. For this reason it will be important to have skills in both leadership and working as part of a team or under leadership. This is also why it is important for my team to establish core agreements and values and to plan for how to deal with unreliable or non participating team members as these are issues we may encounter in a professional environment.
