##Learning experiment

In keeping with the scientific method I approached my learning experiment in phases the first of which is question,
The question or aim for this learning experiment is how can I improve my learning method. 

The next phase is research so I briefly looked at different kinds of learning styles such as visual learning for example which was a concept I already had some knowledge on. I then thought back to how I normally consume and put into practice learning material from this subject and others and concluded that I generally watch all lecture videos consecutively and then work through practical or assignment work. Normally as I work these tasks I end up needing to review lecture materials or look for help from other sources as I often fail to remember all details from the lecture 
videos. I concluded that this is likely a result of consuming them all in a very quick manner and that perhaps I should change my learning style to be more conducive to absorbing the information in the videos. 

My hypothesis is that consuming the videos at a slower pace while taking notes or trying to practice the skills that are being demonstrated in the will make me more likely to remember the lecture material when applying the information from them in the future. 

For the testing phase I put into practice the learning style changes outlined above. While watching the lecture videos I paused numerous times to take notes and a handful of times I rewatched segments that I either didn’t fully understand on first viewing or that seemed more information heavy. I also took a short break between both lecture videos to give my self time to process the information. While something of this nature can’t be measured empirically I do feel that I got a stronger grasp of the information in this weeks lectures regarding custom themes and will be able to apply this knowledge in the assignment.


##Content insights:

The lecture provided a lot of key information about the difference between a custom theme and a child theme and the processing of creating a custom theme. One key take away was the concept of boiler plate code and how for our role of creating websites inside of content management systems such as WordPress it is not necessary to have the deepest understanding of all code in a theme but rather that we need to know how to manipulate the aspects needed to create a new theme. The plugins that were demonstrated are also a great insight into how the process can be streamlined and made more modular.

##Employability insights:
in terms of employability there is an industry for the production and sale of custom WordPress themes. The lecture videos outline how WordPress facilitates this market with their own regulated theme repository which users can submit their custom themes into. There are also different distribution or business models such as open source, freemium models or upfront payment for use of custom themes.
